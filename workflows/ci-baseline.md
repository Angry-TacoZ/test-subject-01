# GitHub CI Baseline

For a maintained software repository:

1. Configure GitHub Actions for pull requests and pushes to the default branch.
2. Install dependencies using the repository's documented method.
3. Run the repository's canonical verifier, `npm run verify`, which currently covers the production build and desktop/mobile browser smoke checks. Add lint, deterministic tests, type checks, and security scans to that verifier when they are configured safely.
4. Keep ordinary CI deterministic and non-destructive.
5. Avoid production credentials when tests and builds can run without them.
6. When permissions allow it, require stable CI checks before merging.
7. If CI is intentionally skipped, document the reason.
8. Treat passing CI as evidence, not as an unqualified production-readiness claim.
